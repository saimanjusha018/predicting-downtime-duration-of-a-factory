# predicting-downtime-duration-of-a-factory
Problem_statement: An electric car manufacturing company,  with several factories is seeing exponential growth in demand due to the sudden increase of subsidies for EVs in the country. The car manufacturer, however, is not able to handle the demand and has tasked a team of Data Science consultants to identify potential areas to quickly increase the efficiency without operational changes. The team of Data Science consultants saw that without changing any of the data that is being collected, a predictive model can be built that predicts the downtime of a factory, thereby allowing the few engineers present in the engineering team to very quickly most important factories that would cause the most significant downtime. The Chief Data Scientists have now curated a dataset, where we have several variables that it believes impact the `downtime_duration`. They have tracked three different downtime durations.




The three classes of `downtime_duration`
  0 - Low downtime (15 minutes to 1 hour)
  1 - Downtime that lasts anywhere between 1 hour and 24 hours
  2 - for long downtimes that can last from 24 hours to sometimes even several days
You will now have to use this curated data to create a machine learning model that will be able to predict the `downtime_duration` so that the company can betterhandle downtimes and increase operational efficiency to better handle demand.
